# Satellite_simulation
The OpenGL project I've developed simulates a satellite orbiting a planet, showcasing the beauty and complexity of celestial motion. The project provides a realistic depiction of the satellite's movement, taking into account gravitational forces and orbital mechanics.

Key features of the project include:

1. Realistic Rendering: The simulation utilizes OpenGL to render visually stunning 3D graphics, accurately depicting the planet's surface, atmosphere, and surrounding space. The textures and shading techniques employed create a visually immersive experience.

2. Gravity Simulation: The project incorporates realistic gravitational forces, allowing the satellite to orbit the planet in a physically accurate manner. The gravitational pull from the planet influences the satellite's trajectory, resulting in an authentic simulation of celestial motion.

3. User Interaction: Users can interact with the simulation, adjusting parameters such as the initial satellite velocity, orbital radius, and planet characteristics. This interactivity enhances the user experience and facilitates experimentation with different orbital scenarios.

4. User Interface: The project features an intuitive user interface that provides information about the satellite's position, velocity, and orbit parameters. Users can easily navigate through different views and toggle display options to observe the simulation from various perspectives.

5. Real-Time Simulation: The simulation runs in real-time, ensuring smooth and continuous movement of the satellite as it orbits the planet. This real-time nature allows users to observe and analyze the dynamics of the satellite's motion efficiently.

Overall, this OpenGL project offers an engaging and educational experience, allowing users to witness the elegance and intricacy of celestial mechanics as they observe a satellite gracefully orbiting a planet.
